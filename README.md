# SimIR
  
SimIR: R scripts to simulate RNA-seq experiments with known levels of Intron Retention (IR).
These scripts were devised and used to evaluate (relative) IR metrics [1].
  
RNA-seq reads are generated using the R package [Polyester](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/polyester.html) [2], available from Bioconductor.
